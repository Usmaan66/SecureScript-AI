# SecureScript-AI

SecureScript AI
Designed and implemented a comprehensive AI-powered cyber security platform. Utilized and further trained CodeBERT and
SecBERT models alongside pattern-based analysis to detect security vulnerabilities to deliver 4 components:
 VS Code Extension: Provides real-time vulnerability detection and fix suggestions directly within the Visual Studio Code
editor. Implemented the project using Python, leveraging librosa and pydub librariesfor enhanced performance and accuracy.
 GitHub Pull Request Scanner: Automatically reviews code in pull requests before committing to a repo to detect and
comment on potential security issues.
 GitHub Repository Scanner: Scans entire codebases for security vulnerabilities using AI models and static analysis and
generates a comprehensive report.
 Website Vulnerability Scanner: Analyzes live websites for common security misconfigurations, outdated libraries, and
frontend vulnerabilities. Produces detailed, downloadable security reports with issue severity and recommended fixes.
